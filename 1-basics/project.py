"""
Here you will build a program that computes the roots of a quadratic of the form ax**2 + bx + c using the 
quadratic calculator. The program will ask the user for a, b, and c, and then return the two roots x = r1, r2. 
For the purposes of this project, you can assume both roots are real. Real ones programmed this in BASIC into
their TI-84's to cheat in algebra. 

The execution of the program in the terminal MUST match the following: 

Please provide coefficients for ax**2 + bx + c
a? [input for a]
b? [input for b]
c? [input for c]
Roots: 
x = [root 1]
x = [root 2]
